# TrojanHacks Strikes Back 2018 Project: USC Bingo
Made in a 24-hour period and based entirely in HTML/CSS and JavaScript, this program creates bingo boards for the user to play on based on certain USC-focused categories. Clicking the picture of the students, for example, will generate a bingo board with USC student-focused information in the squares, whereas clicking the picture of the football players will generate athletics-focused information. Notice that reloading the bingo board page randomizes the information in board squares so no two playthroughs are completely identical.

## Team members

 Elizabeth Zhou, Sean Vovan, Cameron Podd, and Laurence Fong. At the start of the Hackathon in which this project was made, none of us had any experience using JavaScript and only Laurence had encountered HTML/CSS before.

## Features to Implement

* A multiplayer function, where two players could compete to fill his/her own board faster than their opponent 
* The ability for the user to create their own bingo boards
* Geofencing, such that the program automatically selects a board for you based upon your current location (Being near a football field would automatically select the football-based bingo board, for example).
